I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne studying the contextual factors and characteristics of information that drive us to seek it.

There are a lot of questions surrounding our consumption of information that we don't fully understand:

*Why do we tend to prefer information that supports our existing beliefs?*

*How can we make accurate information more desirable?*

*How can we limit the spread of misinformation and disinformation online?*

These are a few examples of the questions that guide my research interests. I combine experimental design from cognitive psychology with computational modelling to address these questions.
